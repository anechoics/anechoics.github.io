I recently built another synth in an Ikea Knagglig box. This time I used the larger one. The process is basically the same as in [the previous post]({% post_url 2020-05-17-Second-mini-gig-rig %}), the one difference being a little shim was required on both sides as teh rails are shorter than the box, but about half a centimetre. I also chopped off the bottom row of panels, to make it closer in height to the smaller boxes. I think it looks pretty cool.
