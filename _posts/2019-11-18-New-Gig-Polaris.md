We're pleased as punch to have been invited to play at the opening night of Polaris, a new 
modular night for Bristol occuring at [the Old England](https://www.facebook.com/TheOldE/).


> Polaris is a new experimental night, launching with Bristol's finest Modular artists.
>
> Witness the electronic equivalent of improvisational jazz,
> with the immediacy and impact of music generated on the fly.
>
> No presets, backing tapes or computers, just pure unadulterated modular joy.

We'll be playing with Andrenomachine (who I've seen online but not IRL) & Finlay Shakespeare 
(who was also at the [Rough Trade WAPS](/performance/2019/10/20/WAPS-rough-trade.html).

Get [tickets from Headfirst](https://www.headfirstbristol.co.uk/#date=2019-11-28&event_id=58938) and 
tell you're friends, family & distant acquaintances that you're [going on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/2475550339397539/).
