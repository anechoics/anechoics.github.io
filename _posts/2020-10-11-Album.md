Over the next few months we'll be recording and releasing an album. It's been funded via [Grant For The Web][gftw] as part of [Audiotarky][audiotarky], a platform that's been set up to help musicians increase & diversify their income from musical exploits.

We're in the planning stages at the moment, but know we'll be recording at the [Playpen][playpen] with Ali Chant in November (or maybe December), and the theme of our improvisations (top secret!). We'll be using our various modular systems, some keyboards that we have (and maybe a few Ali has), and there's even a chance we'll include some acoustic instruments, too, for a bit of variety. It should be a fun experience, and we'll try to document it here as it happens. Stay tuned...
